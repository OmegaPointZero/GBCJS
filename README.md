# GBCJS
GameBoy Color JS, my first attempt at emulating a GBC, built on Javascript with JQuery for the UI. 

1. UI
Completely lacking. Nothing drawn yet. Basic info about the loaded file is displayed.

2. Virtualization
So far, only the most basic processor functions (8-bit load/read, special instructions like NOP, HALT and STOP), minimal memory mapping. No audio, GPU or Memory Bank management implemented yet.
